# Readings & Deep Research

This repository is dedicated to organizing the documents I read and to keeping track of all AI-generated "deep research" results. It is intended as a public resource for sharing insights, analyses, and references related to my reading and research activities.

## Structure
- **Topic Folders**: Each folder is named after a topic and contains both the documents (e.g., PDFs) and the AI-generated research results related to that topic.
- **AI Research Results**: Outputs, summaries, and analyses generated by AI tools are stored alongside the original documents within each topic folder.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use the resources for your own research!
